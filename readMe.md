Description
OMDB API Example
In this project we'll use JQuery and Ajax to make a call to the OMDB
(Open Movie DataBase) API. This will return a JSON that we'll then use
as an object array and display on the DOM.

Once you've completed that, add some basic styling and make things look
less sterile.

Finally, consider the following upgrades:

alert the user if they left the input empty when trying to search
remove movies from the DOM after a search
instead of replacing the existing search results, append more movies to the
DOM on the next search (an array sound handy for this)
JQuery animations for transitions
any other ideas you've got that you have been wanting to try output
